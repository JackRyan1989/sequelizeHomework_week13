# friendfinder

Are you lonely? Looking for some quality bonding time with a fellow human (males only available at the moment)?
Then look no further than the *friendfinder* application!
Answer a few of our patented questions and you'll be on your way to a lifetime of "friendship" whether you want it or not. 

How to find your newest and best friend (who is contractually obligated to literally be at your side no mater what):

1. Visit https://warm-tor-80924.herokuapp.com/
2. Click the 'Find a Friend Today' button to begin your journey into friendship!
3. On the Survey page, click the 'Begin' button.
4. Enter your name and respond to each of our patented and SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN questions. 
5. Once done with the survey, submit your results and bask in the glory of your new friendship!
6. You cannot end this friendship once it has begun. All friendships are final, in that they are the last friendship you will ever have.

How can you trust our (patented*) matching process, you say? Well, just sit back dear friend and let me tell you:

1. Your answers are saved as an array in an object along with your name
2. This information is passed back to our super secret servers located somewhere other than where you think they are.
3. Your answer array is compared to the answer arrays existing in our FRIENDSHIP DATABASE (patent pending).
4. The comparison algorithm is complex, but perhaps your feeble and friendless mind can comprehend that each answer in the friend's answer array is subracted from yours, leaving a difference metric. 
5. These difference metrics are reduced to a single value. Whichever friend has the smallest reduced difference metric is then permanently assigned to you for life. 
6. Thanks us later!
